**The problem Vidhira solves**

Vidhira is a decentralized web application designed  for the original content creators that includes digital artists, sketch artists, photographers etc who want to showcase their creation without having to worry about their content being reposted, by another individual on the platform, without getting the content creation credits.
Whenever an user uploads a post it is stored in IPFS, and the hash value of the image is available on the stream.
If another user tries to download the image from the original content creator's account and repost on his account then the image will be reposted with content credits of the user who owns the original content. Also the duplicate image is not uploaded on the stream thereby providing the original data on the market place.
